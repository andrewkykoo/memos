# Andrew Koo

Hey, I'm a Software Engineer based in New York, NY.

I started my career transforming raw data into meaningful insights, creating dashboard applications, and communicating these findings to both colleagues and clients.

Driven to provide end users with tailored and interactive applications, I sought out the expertise of software engineers and soon discovered a deep passion for the art of software development.

Since then, my passion for programming has grown stronger day by day.
