# Andrew Koo

Hey, I'm a Software Engineer based in New York, NY.

I started my career converting data into meaningful insights and visualizing them.

Driven to serve the needs of end users, I wanted to build highly customizable and interactive dashboard applications. So I reached out to software engineers for their expertise and quickly fell in love with the art of software development.

Since then, I am feeling more passionate about programming day after day.
